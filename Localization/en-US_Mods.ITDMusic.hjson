SongNames: {
	// Some of the song keys are named after old themes, don't mind this.
	// For future additions, keep the key names as general and descriptive as possible.
	// Example, for, let's say, Thalassateus' theme, just name the music file Thalassateus, not the title of the music.
	// This will make it less confusing if there are any songs that are placeholders or are otherwise going to be replaced.
